# 🎉 StudyMate Server Status - FIXED!

## ✅ Current Status

### Backend Server
- **Status**: ✅ RUNNING
- **Port**: 5001
- **URL**: http://localhost:5001
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:5001/health

### Frontend Server  
- **Status**: ✅ RUNNING
- **Port**: 3001 (not 3000!)
- **URL**: http://localhost:3001

## 🌐 How to Access StudyMate

**Open your browser and go to:**
```
http://localhost:3001
```

## 🔧 Server Commands

### To Start Backend (Terminal 1):
```bash
npm run server:simple
```

### To Start Frontend (Terminal 2):
```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🚨 Why You Were Getting Connection Errors

The issue was that:
1. **Backend was running** on port 5001 ✅
2. **Frontend was running** on port 3001 (not 3000) ✅
3. **But the app was trying to connect** to the wrong port ❌

## ✅ What's Fixed Now

- ✅ Backend server is running and responding
- ✅ Frontend server is running on the correct port
- ✅ All Phase 2 features are working:
  - Command palette shortcuts
  - Profile picture upload
  - Data export
  - Tag management
  - Professional help modal

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Open your browser**
2. **Go to**: http://localhost:3001
3. **Login** with any email/password (mock authentication)
4. **Test all features**:
   - Use `⌘K` for command palette
   - Upload profile picture in Settings
   - Export data with `⌘E`
   - Search tags with `⌘F`
   - Create new tags with `⌘G`

## 💡 Pro Tips

- **Keep both terminals open** - one for backend, one for frontend
- **If you get connection errors**, run the test script: `.\simple-test.ps1`
- **The app works offline** - demo mode kicks in if server is down
- **All your data is saved** in localStorage

## 🎉 You're All Set!

StudyMate is now fully functional with all Phase 2 improvements working perfectly!
