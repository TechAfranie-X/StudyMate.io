# StudyMate Debugging Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. ✅ Backend Server Connection Issues

**Problem**: Frontend showed "Unable to connect to the server. Please ensure the backend server is running on port 5001."

**Root Cause**: 
- Server was not running consistently
- Health endpoint was not accessible at the root level
- Missing proper error handling for server connection failures

**Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ Added health check route at root level (`/health`) in `server.js
- ✅ Updated server to run on port 5001 consistently
- ✅ Added proper database connection testing in health endpoint
- ✅ Server now returns `{status: "ok"}` when healthy

**Files Modified**:
- `server.js` - Added root-level health endpoint

### 2. ✅ Frontend Error Handling

**Problem**: Frontend crashed when server was down instead of showing friendly error message.

**Root Cause**: No proper error boundary or server status checking.

**Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ Created `ServerStatus` component that wraps the entire app
- ✅ Added automatic server connection testing every 30 seconds
- ✅ Implemented friendly error UI with retry functionality
- ✅ Updated API utility to provide better error messages

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/ServerStatus.jsx` - New component for server status handling
- `src/App.jsx` - Integrated ServerStatus component
- `src/utils/api.js` - Improved error messages

### 3. ✅ Theme System (Light/Dark Mode)

**Problem**: Theme toggle didn't consistently apply across all pages and could break the UI.

**Root Cause**: 
- Theme context was applying classes to `body` instead of `html`
- Tailwind dark mode wasn't properly configured
- Missing CSS classes for both `.dark` and `.dark-mode` selectors

**Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ Updated `ThemeContext` to apply classes to `html` element for Tailwind compatibility
- ✅ Added `darkMode: 'class'` to Tailwind config
- ✅ Updated CSS to support both `.dark` and `.dark-mode` selectors
- ✅ Ensured theme persistence in localStorage

**Files Modified**:
- `src/contexts/ThemeContext.jsx` - Fixed theme application
- `tailwind.config.js` - Added dark mode configuration
- `src/index.css` - Enhanced dark mode CSS support

### 4. ✅ API Configuration

**Problem**: Frontend API configuration was correct but needed better error handling.

**Root Cause**: Generic error messages didn't specify the correct port.

**Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ Updated error messages to specifically mention port 5001
- ✅ Improved network error detection and handling

**Files Modified**:
- `src/utils/api.js` - Enhanced error messages

## Current Status

### ✅ Backend Server
- **Status**: Running on port 5001
- **Health Endpoint**: `http://localhost:5001/health` ✅
- **Database**: Connected and working ✅
- **Routes**: All API routes accessible ✅

### ✅ Frontend
- **Status**: Running on development server
- **Server Connection**: Automatic detection and error handling ✅
- **Theme System**: Consistent light/dark mode across all pages ✅
- **Error Handling**: Friendly error messages with retry functionality ✅

### ✅ Database
- **Status**: Connected and working
- **Migrations**: No changes needed - data preserved
- **Tasks**: All existing tasks maintained

## Testing Results

### Backend Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:5001/health
# Returns: {"status":"ok","message":"Database connection is working","timestamp":"..."}
```

### Frontend Connection
- ✅ Server status component detects connection
- ✅ Shows loading state while checking
- ✅ Displays friendly error if server is down
- ✅ Provides retry functionality

### Theme System
- ✅ Toggle works consistently across all pages
- ✅ Theme persists in localStorage
- ✅ Dark mode applies to all components
- ✅ No UI breaking issues

## How to Use

### Starting the Application

1. **Start Backend Server**:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
   Server will start on port 5001 with health endpoint at `/health`

2. **Start Frontend**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Frontend will automatically detect server status and show appropriate UI

### Theme Toggle
- Use the theme toggle in the settings or navigation
- Theme automatically applies to all pages
- Theme preference is saved and restored on page reload

### Server Connection
- If server is down, you'll see a friendly error message
- Click "Retry Connection" to attempt reconnection
- Server status is checked automatically every 30 seconds

## Files Modified Summary

### Backend Files
- `server.js` - Added health endpoint and improved error handling
