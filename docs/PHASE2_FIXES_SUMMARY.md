## Technical Implementation Details

### Command Palette Enhancements
```javascript
// New commands added to CommandPalette.jsx
{
  id: 'search-tags',
  title: 'Search Tags',
  description: 'Find tasks by tags',
  icon: '🏷️',
  shortcut: '⌘F',
  category: 'Tasks'
},
{
  id: 'create-tag',
  title: 'Create New Tag',
  description: 'Create a new tag for organizing tasks',
  icon: '➕',
  shortcut: '⌘G',
  category: 'Tasks'
}
```

### Profile Picture System
```javascript
// Image upload and storage
const handleImageUpload = (event) => {
  const file = event.target.files[0]
  // Validation and processing
  const reader = new FileReader()
  reader.onload = (e) => {
    const imageData = e.target.result
    setProfileImage(imageData)
    localStorage.setItem('studymate_profile_image', imageData)
  }
  reader.readAsDataURL(file)
}
```

### Export Functionality
```javascript
// CSV export implementation
const handleExportData = () => {
  const tasks = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('studymate_tasks') || '[]')
  const csvContent = [
    ['Title', 'Description', 'Status', 'Priority', 'Due Date', 'Created At'],
    ...tasks.map(task => [/* task fields */])
  ].map(row => row.map(field => `"${field}"`).join(',')).join('\n')
  
  // Create and download file
  const blob = new Blob([csvContent], { type: 'text/csv;charset=utf-8;' })
  // Download logic...
}
```
